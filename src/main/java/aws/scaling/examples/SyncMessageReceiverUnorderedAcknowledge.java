/**
 * An example class to demonstrate the behavior of UNORDERED_ACKNOWLEDGE mode for received messages. This example
 * complements the example given in {@link SyncMessageReceiverClientAcknowledge} for CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE mode.
 * <p>
 * First, a session, a message producer, and a message consumer are created. Then, two messages are sent. Next, two messages
 * are received but only the second one is acknowledged. After waiting for the visibility time out period, an attempt to
 * receive another message is made. It's shown that the first message received in the prior attempt is returned again
 * for the second attempt. In UNORDERED_ACKNOWLEDGE mode, all the messages must be explicitly acknowledged no matter what
 * the order they're received.
 * <p>
 * This ISN'T the behavior for CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE mode. Please see {@link SyncMessageReceiverClientAcknowledge}
 * for an example.
