/**
 * An example class to demonstrate the behavior of CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE mode for received messages. This example
 * complements the example given in {@link SyncMessageReceiverUnorderedAcknowledge} for UNORDERED_ACKNOWLEDGE mode.
 * <p>
 * First, a session, a message producer, and a message consumer are created. Then, two messages are sent. Next, two messages
 * are received but only the second one is acknowledged. After waiting for the visibility time out period, an attempt to
 * receive another message is made. It's shown that no message is returned for this attempt since in CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE mode,
 * as expected, all the messages prior to the acknowledged messages are also acknowledged.
 * <p>
 * This ISN'T the behavior for UNORDERED_ACKNOWLEDGE mode. Please see {@link SyncMessageReceiverUnorderedAcknowledge}
 * for an example.
